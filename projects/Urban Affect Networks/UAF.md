## Urban Affect Networks<br/>

#### Project Overview<br/>
Urban Affect Networks emerged from a broader project entitled 'Auditory Display for Large-scale IoT Networks' carried out at the CONNECT Centre Trinity College Dublin. The Urban Affect Networks project links live electronic music performance, IoT Network Data, and Generative Music techniques. Each performance draws data from networks of IoT devices placed around Dublin City. Sensor and network data are mapped to control parameters of the live performance. How this takes place is mediated by a generative music system called PerformIOT. The mood or affective state of the system is determined by the state of Dublin city, as represented through the IoT sensor data. The system's mood in turn determines the musical choices it makes while improvising alongside a human performer. Each performance with the system is unique as it represents a complex array of data relations that describe the state of Dublin City and any given time. The project involved the iterative development of the system with each performance acting as an evaluation after which the system would be expanded and further refined. <br />

#### Iteration 1: Direct Mapping<br/>
The first iteration of the 'PerformIoT' system was designed with the direct mapping of IoT data to auditory parameters in mind. The system would react to a live improvisation by an instrumental performer, in this case, an electric guitarist, in real-time. The state of the city as represented in the IoT data would directly determine different sonic parameters during the performance.
The bulk of the functional code is written in Python and it is used to extend the capabilities of Ableton Live to leverage and map the IoT data. This early version of the system grew out of work undertaken to sonify IoT network data from several sources at CONNECT, the Science Foundation Ireland Research Centre for Future Networks headquartered at Trinity College Dublin.

#### Performance 1: Sonic Dreams 2017<br/>
The first use for the system was for the piece 'Noise Loops for Laptop, Improvised Electric Guitar and Dublin City Noise Data'. This was performed at the 2017 Sonic Dreams Festival. In this piece, IoT data from sensors measuring ambient noise levels around Dublin city was mapped to control the performance parameters of a live electric guitar improvisation. The data was mapped to control the timbre of the guitar utilizing a multiband distortion to morph the sound. The data was also mapped to control advanced buffer, delay, and filtering processing of the performance and that also controlled the synthesis of percussive elements within the performance. In this iteration, the system was mapped to control live DSP process which mashed up and remixed the performance in realtime based on the IoT data <br />

#### Iteration 2: Generative Systems & Musical Interactions<br/>
The second iteration of the 'PerformIoT' system involved procedural approaches to generative music informed by the works of Brian Eno, Steve Reich, and Terry Riley. It generated harmonic and sonic materials at the level of the individual object/note/event. The mode of musical interaction here was changed also. The system no longer reacted to an electric guitar performance but instead reacted to improvised electronic music generated by the performer. This system employed liine’s Lemur app for iOS to control the synthesis of audio materials in Native Instrument’s Reaktor and the Ableton Live Wavetable Synth. Reaktor also ran patches employing a mixture of additive and subtractive synthesis techniques to generate audio materials. This opened up a wealth of new possibilities for mapping Iotdata to sonic parameters. The system was also expanded here to allow IoT data to be 'played back' at a variety of user-defined rates moving away from a purely real-time model for using the data. </br >

#### Performance 2: xCoAx 2018<br/>
The next performance with the system titled 'Signal to Noise Loops i++'' took place at xCoAx in Madrid in 2018. This performance involved the more refined version of the PerformIOT system which had been further developed after the SAW festival performance. The system was updated to generate music alongside the human performer. Essentially, the system would 'listen' to what the human performer played and then make decisions about what it wanted to play, and whether or not it wanted to intervene in the human’s performance. When the IoT data represented a healthy, happy, calm city the system would embellish the performance and when the data represented a more chaotic city, the system would disregard the performance replacing it with harsh sounding procedurally generated harmonic materials. I gave a talk describing how this iteration of the system worked at the conference and took part in a broader artists panel also.<br />

#### Iteration 3: Evolutionary Algorithms <br/>
The third iteration of the system introduced evolutionary approaches to generative music influenced by Eduardo Reck Miranda and Alan Dorin. The evolutionary algorithms generated and organised content within the performance at the textural and timbral levels. This iteration of the system made use of new IoT data sources. The system was now 'making decisions based on the ‘mood’ or ‘affective state’ of Dublin city. The system accesses the IoT data and reads noise levels, pollution levels, traffic flows (pedestrian and vehicle), emergency warnings, and weather data. These data points define the affective state or mood of the generative system and data to sound mapping strategy, and thereby the music. <br />
When the data represents a healthy and functioning city the generative system is in a good mood and collaborates better with the human performer in a harmonious manner, coordinating its music-making with that of the human. When the city is in a sub-optimal state, the system has a 'negative affective state' or 'mood' and begins to overwrite the human performer and make more independent musical decisions that are reflective of the state of the city.<br />

#### ISSTA & CSMC 2018<br/>
A third performance took place at ISSTA 2018 in Derry/Londonderry. This version made use of evolutionary approaches to generative music. A fourth performance took place at CSMC 2018 in Dublin. In this performance, the wider set of data sources described above are mapped to control a range of sound synthesis, timbral and performance parameters in the piece. <br />

### Iteration 4: Machine Learning
While the earlier systems used procedural techniques alone to generate materials at the level of the note/object/event version 4 integrates machine learning tools alongside procedural techniques. The system uses Google Magenta's 'Continue' tool (using RNNs) to elaborate upon the data-driven, procedurally generated harmonic materials. It also uses 'Interpolate' (driven by MusicVAE) to generate a series of melodies with qualities lying along a linear spectrum <i>between</i> two input melodic sequences.

### COVID-19 Crisis Response <br />
While working on the fourth iteration of the system the COVID-19 Crisis hit. To continue the project, I chose to adapt it to an online mode of presentation. I also chose to make use of data representing the city before the COVID-19 crisis hit as well as during the COVID-19 crisis. This involved using the new iteration of the system to create a fixed composition in two movements. In the interests of clarity, I used one stream of data, the original Noise Data. The first movement used data from March of 2019 while the second movement used data from March 2020.
Alongside the piece, I also created a visualisation of the data which maps the Noise data to control the radii and colours of dots in a dot-matrix representation of Dublin City.

### New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival and International Conference on Computer Music
The piece is scheduled for performance at the 2021 New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival and the International Conference on Computer Music 2021.


### Discussion <br />
The point of mapping data to sound, and more specifically IoT data is to leverage some of the interesting patterns that present themselves across data streams/sets of this manner. Data-driven music is different from sonification where the point is to faithfully communicate or represent the data to the listener. Data-driven music is closer in many ways to algorithmic music composition than it is to sonification because of its focus on finding patterns in the data that might be interesting when mapped to sonic and musical parameters. My previous data-driven music work has employed algorithmic composition techniques and dealt with used from the global financial crash. More recently I have begun to work with IoT data as I believe that the kinds of data we choose to measure and our reasons for measuring them say a lot about what a society values, cares about, and finds interesting while the specific data measurements chronicle the complex interactions between people, the technologies they create and the worlds in which those people and technologies are situated. <br />
<br />
While these explicit points of information may not be directly represented in a performance the rich interleaved patterns of interaction between people, place and technology are transposed into the sonic realm in each performance. While more abstract and implicit in nature it is the aesthetic dimensionality of these interlocked patterns, which is of interest to me. <br />
