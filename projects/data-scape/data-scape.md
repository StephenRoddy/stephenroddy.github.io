### Data-scape: A Personalised Framework for Multimodal Data Analytics

#### Project Description
I am currently working on a framework for Multimodal Data Analytics that draw upon my research over the past 9 years.
The prototype is being built with COVID-19 data data but the framework will be usable with a wide range of data sources upon completion.

This project is to develop a react and bootstrap based framework for multimodal data analytics.

Essentially it can integrates graphs and maps from ApexCharts and d3.js, audio from Tone.js and HTML5 Canvas & WebGL based animations.

The framework will be usable as a front-end alternative to purely visual dashboards and will allow data to be represented with images, sound and animated visuals.

In its current state the framework consists of a simple dashboard.
This will be improved upon with new features over the next 12 months

The end result will present a user with bespoke, personalised data dashboards.
Users will be able to register for an account and login to save their dashboards and the different data that feed those dashboards.

You check in on the development of the platform and see it  in its current state here:
