### Auditory Display for Large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) Networks.

#### Project Description
I am currently working on a framework for Multimodal Data Analytics that draw upon my research over the past 9 years.
The prototype is being built with COVID-19 data data but the framework will be usable with a wide range of data sources upon completion.

This project is to developing a react and bootstrap based framework for multimodal data analytics.
Essentially it can integrates graphs and maps from ApexCharts and d3.js, audio from Tone.js and HTML5 Canvas & WebGL based animations.

The framework will be usable as a front-end alternative to purely visual dashboards and will allow data to be represented with images, sound and animated visuals.
