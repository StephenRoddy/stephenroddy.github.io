## Sound, Music & Audio Production
<!--
### Original 

I've been playing and writing music since the early 2000s. In 2013 I started putting music online. Mostly I just make a collection where all the pieces are similar enough to work as a single release. I then drop them on the internet with no real fanfare or hubbub. Other times a collection grows out of a project or idea I've been working on or interested in. Between 2013 and 2019 I put a lot of music online.

The first collection of music I put online was Alethia. It came together around 2012. I'd just moved to a new town and left a couple of miserable tech roles to pursue a PhD on a shoestring budget. I needed a creative outlet so I finished some musical ideas that had been knocking around my head since college and added a number of preppy little electronic numbers. It was an internal rebellion against the wave of hyper boring experimental music I had hitherto encountered in academia. https://distrokid.com/hyperfollow/stephenroddy/bdH5

Line-In R was the second collection I put online. I revisited old unreleased material and began to integrate the very few aspects of electroacoustic and experimental composition that I had any respect for. I began to find my own original voice with these pieces. I also began to perform these pieces live and introduce musical ideas to my research.

Terminus Abruptus came about because I wanted to make some more mainstream electronic music with pop and rock influences. It also has a sense of humor. It's a concept album chronicling the adventures of its titular character. One track was reworked from a song originally recorded for an album in 2008. Winter's March leans heavily on traditional sounds but provides some respite from the aggressive onslaught.

The fourth release, Natural Drift, came at a point when I was concerned with reconciling traditional musicality with a more open and exploratory approach. I also began to enjoy pairing music and sound in different ways and more traditional compositional tropes took over here. The title track was composed in one sitting on an out of tune piano in Mary's kitchen. I rediscovered sound art during this period and this release features no guitar.

I made Untitled #1 at a point I was interested in orchestral soundtrack music and wanted to play around with some those sounds and structures. Tracks from this also leaked into Natural Drift. It's the opposite of groundbreaking but its fun. Most of the tracks are repeated on the second half with slightly different instrumentation or sample libraries.

I did my PhD in Auditory Display/Sonification. It is a discipline of human-computer interaction that deals with the representation of data with sound. My approach was empirical and scientific but influenced nonetheless by music theory. While exploring strategies for representing data with sound I would create pieces of music that are driven by data. I used data from the Irish Economic Crash to make a number of these pieces throughout my research.

I love David Bowie. After his sudden death in 2016 I recorded some music. It was intended as a sort of tribute or lament. I titled the collection Stardust Sonata. It's full of spacious, lamentful soundscapes derived from heavily processed guitars. I always wanted to better leverage my guitar playing in my work. This release got me closer.

I began listening to Prince in 2014 two years later he was gone. Purple Waves was something of a tribute. I continued to look for ways to integrate the guitar into my musical practice and my preoccupation with sound art was also shaping the choices I made here. The Improvisation Loops would provide the basis for a future system for live performance.

In 2015 I composed a piece of music for a project AMAE & DePinto. It involved setting the sounds of Jean-Luc Nancy reciting his own indices on the body to sound and music. I produced "21, 7 & 3" for the project and it was performed at Palazzo Grassi, Punta della Dogana in Venice for the Helicotrema Festival. I enjoyed the process a lot and went about setting more of the recordings to music resulting in 'Le Son Du Corps Et Un Corps de Sons'.

In January of 2018, I released my last fixed media pieces on a short release entitled Home. It contained a sample of a recent live performance with a new system I'd developed.

I had spent a lot of time making music and a number of my pieces were performed at festivals and conferences at home and abroad as 'fixed media' pieces. This was unsatisfying as the pieces are simply played back. I began collaborating with other artists again performing live alongside dancers and instrumentalists.
I had looked to recapture some of the excitement of live performance that I'd gotten from these and past collaborations. I borrowed from my background in sonification and integrated it with ideas from AI, IoT and generative music to create a live system that would allow me to perform live while also playing alongside me.
