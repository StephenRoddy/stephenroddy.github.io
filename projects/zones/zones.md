physical### The Zones Project

#### Project Description
Zones was collaborative project between Alan Dormer, Black Bear Software and myself.
It involved the development two mobile-based Augmented Reality (AR) installation systems. AR enriches and enhances our experience of real-world environments by overlaying new perceptual information that seamlessly integrates into our experience of an environment in realtime. This combination of the real and virtual worlds opens up new interactive and experiential possibilities.

#### Project Description

Network and mobile technologies allow us to layer virtual digital spaces on top of real-world spaces introducing new perceptual information that augments our experience of the physical world.

These proximity and location aware systems embedded a l sound and images

These systems were location aware and as users moved through a physical space they would experience sounds and images from other spaces.

location aware systems


The first was developed for public exhibition and was installed at the Craft Village Derry during the 2016 ISSTA Festival.

 We were invited to install the second system was installed at the Digital Empathy Workshop at the Ulster University's Magee campus.

Zones Sound Art Projects


Sonic material
The sonic material is gathered from various recordings, archival recordings, and media outlets and is reflective of the original themes of the piece to explore the geopolitical climate surrounding borders, territory and the flow of people’s. Sound affords the listener a mode of understanding themselves, their world and the mutual relationships by which the two are inexorably linked. This installation exploits that fact to organise the audience’s experience of the piece in a way that reveals their own critical role in, and relationship to, that climate.
Technological implementation
The work will be mediated through a mobile phone application that interacts with a Bluetooth (BLE 4.0) beacon infrastructure. The application, which is
custom and developed for the festival, uses various methods of proximity and triangulation to trigger and develop sonic events. Encouraging movement through this development, each listening experience will produce new material and development based on a number of contextual and software parameters along with varying files based on time of experience. The work will be developed for headphones.
Note: the application will ask for permissions to activate Bluetooth and location services. This is outside of the control of the developers. As technologists it is also outside of our concern.
