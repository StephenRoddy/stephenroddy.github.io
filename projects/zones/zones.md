### The Zones Project

#### Project Description
Zones was collaborative project between Alan Dormer, Black Bear Software and myself.
It involved the development two mobile-based Augmented Reality (AR) installations. AR enriches and enhances our experience of real-world environments by overlaying new perceptual information that seamlessly integrates into our experience of an environment in realtime. This combination of the real and virtual worlds opens up new interactive and experiential possibilities.

#### How it Worked
We created two location/proximity-aware installations that were delivered over mobile devices with headphones. The system mapped audio and images to specific locations within the environments. Participants could then navigate through the spaces and the sounds they were hearing and images they were seeing over the app would change depending on the route they took through the environment.  

#### My Role
My role involved the design of the visual and audio elements for each installation, assistance in the design and testing of the underlying AR framework and to install each piece.

#### Sound design & Sonification
The first installation involved 7 different sonifications of data from the European migrant crisis. Two datasets were used. The first represented the number of migrants lost at sea between the 01/10/2015 and the 24/08/2016 and the second represented Syrian Emigration Rate 2007-2014. Data was acquired from the UNHRC and the World Bank's open data resources.

The 6 sonifications of those lost at sea were created using granular synthesis techniques (in Csound) where audio files containing recordings of the Mediterranean sea were split into tiny pieces called grains and then reassembled to create timbral structures termed 'grain clouds'. The data was mapped to control the parameters of these grain clouds: amplitude, density, transposition factor, octaviation ratio and grain size. The original recording of waves in the Mediterranean sea was  reprocessed to become a sonification. The end result is a sonification that still sounds like the sea, but the sound rises in intensity to reflect the data.

An additional 5 sonifications were created using these techniques.

[Example 2](/MedSon3.mp3)
[Example 3](/MedSon5.mp3)

The data representing the Syrian emigration rate was dealt with differently. This data was mapped to midi control change (CC) values and used to control the level of distortion applied to a tone that was synthesised using wavetable synthesis techniques in Logic Pro X. The results is a drone that grows in intensity to reflect the changes in the original dataset.

Soundscape recordings were gathered from sources in Middle Eastern countries and Europe. Further sound design elements included material taken from TV and Radio broadcasts about the crisis, which were edited into a collage and soundscapes designed to evoke a sense off empty space.

#### Overall Concept

Each installation had a number of live hotspots and as you move towards a hotspot the soundscape you experience over your headphones change. There are distinct locations
Distinct locations:
Syria
Drone place
Mediterranean place
Media
Europe
Idealised Empty place

Additional sonification strategies were explored also

Soundscape recordings were gathered from sources in Middle Eastern countries and Europe.

Further sonic elements were synthesised using a variety of synthesis techniques.

#### Iteration 2

Network and mobile technologies allow us to layer virtual digital spaces on top of real-world spaces introducing new perceptual information that augments our experience of the physical world.

These systems were location aware and as users moved through a physical space they would experience sounds and images from other spaces.

The first was developed for public exhibition and was installed at the Craft Village Derry during the 2016 ISSTA Festival.

Zones Sound Art Projects


Sonic material
The sonic material is gathered from various recordings, archival recordings, and media outlets and is reflective of the original themes of the piece to explore the geopolitical climate surrounding borders, territory and the flow of people’s. Sound affords the listener a mode of understanding themselves, their world and the mutual relationships by which the two are inexorably linked. This installation exploits that fact to organise the audience’s experience of the piece in a way that reveals their own critical role in, and relationship to, that climate.
Technological implementation
The work will be mediated through a mobile phone application that interacts with a Bluetooth (BLE 4.0) beacon infrastructure. The application, which is
custom and developed for the festival, uses various methods of proximity and triangulation to trigger and develop sonic events. Encouraging movement through this development, each listening experience will produce new material and development based on a number of contextual and software parameters along with varying files based on time of experience. The work will be developed for headphones.
Note: the application will ask for permissions to activate Bluetooth and location services. This is outside of the control of the developers. As technologists it is also outside of our concern.
