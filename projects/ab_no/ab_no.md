### Project Overview

### Writings

The following articles outline how Kyoto School thinking has shaped sound art practice.
The article in [Resonance: The Journal of Sound And Culture](https://online.ucpress.edu/res/article/4/1/69/195805/The-Kyoto-School-and-Sound-ArtA-Nothingness-of-the) explores intersections between the Kyoto School and relevant 20th-century art movements analyzing key sound art pieces in relation to important themes developed in Kyoto School thought .
The conference paper presented at [Invisible Places](http://invisibleplaces.org/) provides a higher level overview of the topic focusing mostly on historical perspectives.
