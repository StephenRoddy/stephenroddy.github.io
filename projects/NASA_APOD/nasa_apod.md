<br />
NASA:_APoD - Astronomy Picture of the Day is a web app project I am currently working on.The web app is built with React, Bootstrap and Node.js. It uses Nasa's Astronomy picture of the day API. Everyday NASA share a new image or video through the API, and the current version of the app fetches and presents the media. I am currently working on adding a string of new features and expanding out the project
