<br />

<br />NASA:_APoD is a project I am currently working on.
The web app is built with React, Bootstrap and Node.js and uses Nasa's Astronomy picture of the day API. Everyday NASA share a new image or video through the API.
The latest version of the app fetches and presents the media and I am currently working on adding new features.
