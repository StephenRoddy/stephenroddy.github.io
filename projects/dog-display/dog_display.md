### Project Overview

<br />
dog.display() is a small web app that operates as a front end for some services offered by <a href="https://thedogapi.com" target="_blank"The Dogs Api</a>. Their claim that the API provides "Dogs as a Service" was too good to pass up and the app was developed as a 'tongue in cheek' gift for the birthday of a dog-loving friend. The web app was initially built with React, Bootstrap and Node.js. It retrieves some data about different dogs (breed, size, images etc.) and presents it to the end user.  I am currently working on adding a string of new features and expanding out the project.
