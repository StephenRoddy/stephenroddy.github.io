\### Biography I am an Artist, Researcher, and Lecturer based at Trinity College Dublin (TCD) conducting work in Engineering and the Creative Arts. I hold a Ph.D. in Data Sonification, the use of sound to perceptualize data and convey information. My current work is focused on the application of Sonification, and artificial intelligence/machine learning techniques (AI/ML) in Human-computer Interaction (HCI) and the Creative Arts. My previous project, based at the CONNECT Centre in TCD and funded by an IRC postdoctoral fellowship, explored the design of Sonification and Auditory Display solutions for Large-scale Internet of Things (IoT) networks. My work has been widely disseminated through peer-reviewed journal publications, book chapters, and conferences. I maintain a vibrant and diverse creative arts practice spanning a variety of media and styles including music composition and performance, sound art installation, interactive art and music for dance and stage. My work has been described as dark, eclectic and experimental. My pieces are frequently performed and installed at home and abroad and I have been described as eclectic, dark and experimental. Previous events have included the New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival, Helicotrema Recorded Audio Festival in Venice, Dublin Dance Festival's Embodied at the GPO, and the Sonorities Contemporary Music Festival.
