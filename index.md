Stephen Roddy is a Composer and Engineer working in [Sound and Music Computing (SMC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound_and_music_computing) at the [Radical Humanities Lab](https://www.ucc.ie/en/future-humanities/radicalhumanitieslaboratory/) in the [Future Humanities Institute](https://www.ucc.ie/en/future-humanities/) and the Department of [Digital Humanities](https://www.ucc.ie/en/dah/) at [University College Cork](https://www.ucc.ie/en/) (UCC). He is programme director for the [MA in Digital Arts and Humanities](https://www.ucc.ie/en/cke09/) at UCC and holds a Ph.D. in sonification: the use of sound to perceptualise data and convey information, from Trinity College Dublin (TCD). 
Stephen's research blends methods from [engineering design](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00163-022-00406-y) with [music composition and performance](https://direct.mit.edu/leon/article-abstract/51/1/63/46472/Practice-Based-Research-in-the-Creative-Arts) to explore the application of sonification techniques, [generative systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Generative_music), and [network technologies](https://internetofsounds.net/about/), in [sound and music computing](https://smcnetwork.org/roadmap.html#definition) contexts. It is theoretically grounded with reference to [cybernetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cybernetics), [embodied cognition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embodied_cognition), and [posthumanism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Posthumanism).

Stephen's technical work is currently focused on the development of sonification solutions for the [Internet of Sounds](https://www.ucc.ie/en/dah/news/sonification-and-the-internet-of-sounds.html). His previous technical projects have involved the design of auditory display solutions for large-scale IoT networks and investigated the integration of generative systems, cybernetic design principles, and artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) techniques in automated music synthesis contexts. Much of this work was carried out under an IRC Postdoctoral Fellowship at [CONNECT: the Research Ireland Centre for Future Networks and Communications](https://connectcentre.ie/), at TCD, and subsequently at the Department of Electronic & Electrical Engineering at TCD. His work is widely disseminated through peer-reviewed journal publications, conference proceedings and book chapters. As a member of the committee on Ethically Aligned Design in the Arts (under the IEEE Global Initiative on Ethics of Autonomous and Intelligent Systems), he contributed to the IEEE Standards Authority Report on [Ethically Aligned Approaches to AI in the Arts](https://sagroups.ieee.org/global-initiative/wp-content/uploads/sites/542/2022/07/ead-artists.pdf). 

Stephen maintains a vibrant and diverse creative and performing arts practice which forms a core component of his research activity. His artistic projects span a variety of media and styles, including music composition and performance, generative and data-driven music, and sound art installation and performance. His work, described as [majestic and sweeping](https://avantmusicnews.com/2023/09/10/amn-reviews-stephen-roddy-leviathan-2023-fiadh-productions/) yet [beautifully unsettling](https://www.stephenroddy.com/images/leviathanNewandNotableWide.png), is frequently performed and installed all over the world. His most recent musical releases [Leviathan](https://stephenroddy.bandcamp.com/album/leviathan), [Corpus/Mimesis](https://stephenroddy.bandcamp.com/album/corpus-mimesis), and [Stardust Sonata](https://fiadh.bandcamp.com/album/stardust-sonata) are all available through [Fiadh Productions](https://fiadh.bandcamp.com/). Recent events have included the ElettroAQustica 10 in L'Aquila, New York City Electroacoustic Music Festival and the Earth Rising Festival at the Irish Museum of Modern Art.
